        <h2>Cinema</h2>
          <p>Cinema is one of my biggest passion since i was very young. It was the best way for me to explore his imagination. I think what really captivated me about cinema is the emotions that we can convey by telling a story.</p>

         <p>I started Basketball when i was 5 years old because of my two olders brothers. And it's become one of my passions ever since. I have been playing in competition for 14 years now. And i have developed many great values such as team spirit and perseverance.</p>

        <h2>Traveling</h2>
          <p>I love traveling, because i love discovering new cultures and landscapes. When you travel around the world and see that the way you live is not the only way, you begin to think differently. You become more open-minded, and obviously, you see the beauty of earth.</p>
